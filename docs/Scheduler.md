# Scheduling idea for the OneOS
It is complex to deal with the multiprocessor system as compared to the uniprocessor system. But when there is a need to communicate a large amount of data, this would be helpful.
## Ideal behaviour
1.) OS can manage the resources wisely e.g. how much time will particular process can acquire the i/o device. 

2.) Should balance the load respectively.

3.) OneOS is for the IoT devices, so we are limited with the hardware and we also need to maintain the cost of 

the deices so that users can enjoy it.

4.) There should not be wastage of memory, hence memory should be managed wisely. 
(allocation & deallocation of RAM should done properly)

5.) Scheduler needs to be highly efficient.
